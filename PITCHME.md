# What got you here?:

Need more energy for your projects? How many LEDs can I use in a project? When will an LED explode? Weâ€™ll review kinds of power needed for various projects. Learn how to find the right kind and amount for your project. Charging and recharging storing and using energy for student projects like solar panels, robots, and Arduino.

# Agenda for the day
## Intuition Exercise
* Take all the coin cells and leds and sort by brightnes
## Collecting Energy
## 
## Let's Build Some Learning Adventures:
1. The Power Detective
2. (Bonus) Hunt for Energy: Energey Scavenger Hunt

---
# Let's get started
 ## Inutition Exercise 1
 * Burn out an LED
 * How did you do it?
 ---
 ## Intuition Exercise 2
* Take all the coin cells and leds and sort by brightnes
* Measure the values of the batteries in volts
* Write this down on a big sheet of paper
* Graph the results on x/y plane
* Find the coin cell datasheet 
* Exaimine the graph of voltages
* What's happening here?
* What do we know now?
---
# Datasheet: Coin Cell
* Collect key terms
* Review the graphs vs your own graph
---
# Simulate a battery
* Learn about a Benchtop Variable Power Supply
* Set the voltage and current
* Control a toy motor
* Listen for the pitch of the motor in relation to rotation speed
* Identify what is happening?

# Collect energy with a solar panel
* Take the solar panel and an led try to find where the panel is the brightest.
* Measure with a volt meter the voltage being collected
* Introduce Current
* Measure the current
---
# Solar panels and Motors
* Connect toy motor to solar panel
* Quesetion can you get it to go?
---
# Connect Motor to Power Supply
* How dow we get it to start?
* What values do see when it turns on?
* Create a note list of values
* Slow the motor with your fingers.
* What do you feel?
* You are the resistor
---
# Datasheet: DC Motor
* Collect key terms
* Compare to the graph the data gathered
---
# Unifying the experience with principals
* Resistance
* Current
* Voltage
---
# Finally a discussion of Ohm's Law
* Volts = Current * Resistance
* V = IR
* There is no escape from this principal
---
# Power Principal
* How much work is going on here?
* Watt's
* Power = Volts * Current
* W = V * I
* Calculated for steady state
---
# Power/Work over time Charging batteries

#Brain Storming Acitivites for Students
---
# Adventure: The Power Detective Team/Forensic Experts/Research Scientists
---
# What knowledge do he right now as a power detective?
---
# What Does a Detective Need?
* Multimeter
* Variable Power source
---
# Scene of the crime 1: What has the power?
A motor has fallen apart on the table. What's going on does it work?
Parts: motor, wires with clips, power supply multimeter

Question what is power?
---
# Consult your brain augmentation
* Data sheet
* Ohms Law
* Power Definition
---
# Ohm's Law
