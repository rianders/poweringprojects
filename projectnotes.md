# Power Projects Basics

## The system has to be full to flow.


If we can get people up to speed on the following they will be OK. This is the tech speak. A bit more math needs to be visualized. Relationships visualized too.


So we have:
Voltage
Amperage
Resistance

These are always related:
V = IR, I=V/R, R = V/I

I = Amperage
This is the oomph that it needs to consume. 

V = Voltage
This is the potential of energy it adds to?
Difference in electrical potential between two points.

R = Resistance
This is the resistance in the system. For instance a toy motor connected to a power supply. If you hold the motor or the wheel still. You are providing the resistance. The knobs on the machine show the exact amperage and volts in the system. By grasping looser or tighter you are change the resistance.


But each device has a minimum of volts and amperage before it can even operate. So this system meets those min requirements and provides more so we can add our resistance into the system.

Experiment:
Use the solar panel to collect energy and show it with an LED

Experiment:
Measure the energy from a solar panel

===
Experiment:
The incandescent lamp is the base example.  Heat from the build.


===

Concept:
DC vs AC

Experiment:
Stepper motor and led

===

Concept: Watts
The work done.
W = V*I
W = VI

====
Concept: Battery:  Watt hours
Work performed in specific amount of time

Battery capacity is measured in watt hours. 

Experiment:
Measure a battery.
Drain the battery.
Measure the change.
Calculate the amount of energy used.
